# R Script to join and analyze output from CiliaQ

This template markdown aims to facilitate and automate the analysis of tabular output data generated by CiliaQ. It searches, fetches and joins all CiliaQ output files ('*_CQs.txt*') allowing for a export as .xslx (Excel) file as well as downstream analysis in R. Further, the script implements basic quality control steps and aims to create a brief overview over the retrieved data.

## Installation
Downlaod the [repository](https://github.com/sRassmann/ciliaQ-analysis/archive/master.zip) or directly clone the project [using Git](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). The script war written and tested in R version 4.0.0, however, earlier versions might work as well.  
__Note:__ You should clone the whole project structure, as it also contains the blueprints of additional documents (exclude lists, annoation lists) and custom functions imported into the actual script.

## Usage
Before running the script only the paths, names, and experimental conditions need to be modified (marked with the tag '*TODO*'). Hence, you don't need (higher) skills in R programming. All the steps are explained in the markdown parts of the documents.
